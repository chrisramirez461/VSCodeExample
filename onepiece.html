      <h1>One Piece</h1>
      <p>One Piece is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda. It has been serialized
         in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since July 1997, with its individual chapters
          compiled into 103 tankōbon volumes as of August 2022. The story follows the adventures of Monkey D.
           Luffy, a boy whose body gained the properties of rubber after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit.
          With his pirate crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy explores the Grand Line in search of the deceased 
          King of the Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece" in order to become the 
          next King of the Pirates. One Piece has received praise for its storytelling, art, characterization,
           and humor. It has received many awards and is ranked by critics, reviewers, and readers as one of the
          best manga of all time. Several volumes of the manga have broken publishing records, including the 
          highest initial print run of any book in Japan. In 2015 and 2022, One Piece set the Guinness World 
          Record for "the most copies published for the same comic book series by a single author". It was the 
          best-selling manga for eleven consecutive years from 2008 to 2018, and is the only manga that had an 
          initial print of volumes of above 3 million continuously for more than 10 years, as well as the only 
          that had achieved more than 1 million copies sold in all of its over 100 published tankōbon volumes. 
          One Piece is the only manga whose volumes have ranked first every year in Oricon's weekly comic chart 
          existence since 2008.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>One Piece earned its popularity through its detailed storyline, exciting characters, and creative settings. 
              Premiering in 1999, its animation and characters have grown over the past 2 decades. One Piece continues
               to inspire audiences worldwide and has no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>

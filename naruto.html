        <p>Naruto is a manga by Masashi Kishimoto with an anime TV series adaptation. 
          Its main character, Naruto Uzumaki, is a loud, hyperactive, adolescent ninja who constantly 
          searches for approval and recognition, as well as to become Hokage, who is acknowledged as the 
          leader and strongest of all ninja in the village. The manga was first published by Shueisha in 1999 
          in the 43rd issue of Japan's Shonen Jump magazine. VIZ Media publishes a translated version in the 
          American Shonen Jump, and is currently within a few volumes of the Japanese publication. Naruto has 
          become VIZ Media's best-selling manga series.The anime series, produced by Studio Pierrot and Aniplex, 
          premiered across Japan on the terrestrial TV Tokyo network and the anime satellite television network 
          Animax on October 3, 2002, and is still being aired. Viz also licensed the anime for North American 
          production. Naruto debuted in the United States on Cartoon Network's Toonami programming block on 
          September 10, 2005, and in Canada on YTV's Bionix on September 16, 2005. Naruto began showing in the UK 
          on Jetix on July 22, 2006. It began showing on Toasted TV on January 12, 2007 in Australia, although it 
          could be watched on Cartoon Network in 2006. The first series lasted nine seasons, while the second began 
          its first on February 15, 2007.</p>
        <aside>
          <p>Naruto gives viewers and readers alike a huge cast of characters to look through and invest time
             into. This cast of characters is so vast that there is literally a character for just about 
             anyone to find interest in, whether said character shows up early or later on in the series. 
             Reason why many people catalog this anime as the #1 of 
            "<a href="index.html" id="big3">The Big Three</a>"</p>
